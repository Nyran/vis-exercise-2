    <h1>Exercise 2: Scatterplot Matrix</h1>
    <h2>Task 1: Cell Sizes</h2>
    <p>Compute the constants <em>cellWidth</em> and <em>cellHeight</em> which determine the size of each cell in the
        matrix. The final matrix should fill the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> but leave the amount of pixels given
        in <em>padding</em> to the left and right of the matrix as well as between the rows and columns. Avoid
        non-integer values as they can lead to blurred lines in your final result.</p>
    <h2>Task 2: Color</h2>
    <p>Setup a <em>color</em> scale that encodes the categorical attribute <em>species</em>. If implemented correctly,
        the code cell below the declaration of <em>color</em> should display a legend for the color instead of the hint
        to implement the color scale. Choose an appropriate color scheme from the <a
            href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes">d3 color schemes</a>.</p>
    <h2>Task 3: Scatterplot Matrix</h2>
    <p>The code cell below already sets up the scatterplot matrix but does not draw the data items. Implement the
        drawing of the scatterplot for each cell of the matrix. Use the scales for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that are
        created in the appendix of this document. See the lecture for an image of a scatterplot matrix of the same data
        to validate your result.</p>
    <h2>Task 4: Brushing and Linking</h2>
    <p>The function below sets up a brush for each cell of the scatterplot matrix and is used above. The d3 brush
        already provides all the brushing functionality. The brushing rectangle starts at (<em>x0</em>, <em>y0</em>) and
        goes to (<em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>) with regard to the extent that was set for the brush. Implement the linking
        by de-emphasizing data items that are not inside the brushing area.</p>
